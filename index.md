## Prompt Responses

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
*The problem of convergence in over-paramaterized networks.  Exploring the dynamics of convergence in such settings could lead to valuable insights into the behavior and capabilities of over-parametrized models.*

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
*Modifying parts of Nano-GPT to perform non language tasks and optimiation in those contexts (image recognition)*

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
*While working on Nano-GPT in Quarter 1, one potential improvement lies in enhancing the efficiency of the testing process. Currently, we rely on DSMLP for testing, and the training of the model can be time-consuming. To make the testing phase more efficient, I would explore alternative testing methodologies or perhaps implement optimizations in the testing pipeline. This could involve experimenting with smaller subsets of the data, employing transfer learning techniques, or parallelizing certain testing tasks to reduce overall testing time and resource consumption.*

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
*Maybe more deep-neural network related tasks. Techniques such as attention mechanisms, ensemble learning, or even exploring generative adversarial networks (GANs) could bring new dimensions to the project, enhancing its capabilities and potentially improving performance on complex tasks. *
