## Prompt Responses

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
*The problem of convergence in over-paramaterized networks. It's a pretty intresting concept to find convergence in those settings.*

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
*Modifying parts of Nano-GPT to perform non language tasks and optimiation in those contexts (image recognition)*

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
*I wish the way we tested nano-gpt was more efficent. We have to use DSMLP and it takes a while to train the model sometimes.*

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
*Maybe more deep-neural network related tasks.*
